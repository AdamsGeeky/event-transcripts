# Event Transcripts

## Instructions for Transcribers

1. Pick a video to transcribe (if the column `Transcriber` has a `?`, that means it needs a transcriber.)
1. You can start with the given YouTube preliminary text.

### Requirements
- Attention to details is very important requirement for this task.
- Good spelling and grammar is critical to this task.
- Being comfortable with reading, writing and listening to the English language is important for this task.
- **Helpful:**  It is helpful to have some familiarity with Markdown. 
  - Resource:  [Mastering Markdown](https://github.com/reshamas/ds_resources/blob/master/markdown/mastering_markdown.md) 
- **Helpful:**  It is helpful to know Git so a pull request (PR) can be submitted with edits.
  - Resource:  [Git Intro Workshop](https://github.com/reshamas/git-intro-workshop)
  
### Good Examples 
Here are some examples of transcripts that are well-edited:
1.  scikit-learn Pull Request Example:  [2020/06-reshama-shaikh-sklearn-pr.md](2020/06-reshama-shaikh-sklearn-pr.md)
2.  Emily Robinson Career Talk:  [2020/10-emily-robinson-career.md](2020/10-emily-robinson-career.md)

Here is what the **raw markdown** file looks like:

### Submitting Edits
You can submit edits in either of these formats:  
1. **Pull Request:** Use a code editor and submit a PR (Markdown file).  
1. **Google Doc:**  If you are unfamiliar with how to submit a PR, you can copy the text into a Google doc and edit it there and send back the link to the edited doc.

### Transcribing
- For beginning of sentences, make them capital letters
  - Example:  when "i" as in "i think", can you change to capital letter:  "I think ..."  
- Break sections down into paragraphs (not one whole file)
- For the sections, add some timestamps, so people know where they can find it in the video?  Breaking it down every 10 minutes or so is acceptable. (That would be 6 timestamps for a 1-hour talk.)   
  - Example of sub-section and timestamps
```text
### Set Up Repository (3:46)
```
- Add period to the end of sentences.  
- Fix spelling
  - Example:  PY Ladies  ===>  PyLadies
  - Example: "data umbrella" ===> Data Umbrella
  - Example: "reishmas" ===> Reshama
- When I did this, I listened to the video for a couple of sentences, and then stopped it.  Then I edit the text and then I start the video again for another sentence or two. 

### Notes
- It can take a good 2 to 4 hours to edit a transcript for a 1-hour video.  
- It is not necessary to include screenshots of slides.
