# Emily Robinson: Build a Career in Data Science

video:  https://youtu.be/HsFFuFYz7zE


hi everyone welcome to
data umbrella webinar um also
co-promoted with
nyc pi ladies i'm going to
do a brief introduction and then turn it
over to emily for her presentation
um and then after that what you could do
is you can place any questions in the q
a
and um at the end uh emily will answer
questions
from them but just and just a reminder
to reiterate this talk is being recorded
about me um i'm a statistician and data
scientist um
i'm the founder of data brella and i'm
also an nyc pie ladies organizer
the mission of data umbrella is to
provide a welcoming and educational
space for underrepresented persons in
the field of data science and machine
learning
we welcome allies who support our cause
our home page is dataumbrella.org check
it out we're also on twitter
and we are a volunteer run organization
so any time spent
organizing this event is all on
volunteer time
pi ladies is a global organization and
the new york city chapter
is one of the one of the local chapters
um it's a group for python ladies and
gender minorities of all level
check out our home page there is a very
active slack team that you can join and
it's a really great community if you
have questions on python
it's really it's really i recommend
joining that
code of conduct we have a code of
conduct um we're dedicated providing a
professional harassment free experience
for everybody um and uh thank you for
contributing to making this
you know to fulfilling the mission of
this group which is to make it
make an inclusive friendly community for
people who are under
represented in data science
at the data umbrella website there are
many resources available and i've taken
some screenshots about
contributing to open source about
conferences
about other community groups inclusive
language responsibility social
impact so please check it out
later for more upcoming events uh the
best place to find out about upcoming
events is on the meetup page
so the best thing to do is to join the
meetup group we do
also post them on twitter and linkedin
as well
and facebook uh this talk is being
recorded and
a copy of it will be uploaded to youtube
within the week
all right so we're gonna get started and
i'm gonna turn it over to emily
all right hi everyone i'm just gonna
start sharing my slides
okay right welcome thank you all again
for
joining me i'm very excited to be here
i wanted to give a little bit of a
background about where this talk came
from
so this talk is titled same title as my
book
uh build a career in data science which
is
all about the non-technical skills and
knowledge you need to
get started and succeed in a data
science career so if you
haven't seen the book before if you're
interested after this talk and learning
more
you can get 40 off with the code mtp
umbrella 20. i'll also show that at the
end at datasidecareer.com and that
code's also good for 40
off everything on manning which has a
lot of technical books
on you know coding in python or r or
whatever kind of things you want to do
in this talk i'm going to focus on the
first six chapters of the book
so this covers getting started with data
science what it is the skills
and then some of the first steps about
finding a data science job
all right what is data science
i really like this definition from
kassie kozikov which is that data
science is a discipline
of making data useful i like this
definition because it's pretty
all-encompassing
right so folks can define data science
as oh it's just you know machine
learning
it's just you know this area but i
really do think that
just like you know you might not say
you're a professional writer but all of
us do writing as part of our jobs many
people besides just those who have the
title data scientists can be doing data
science
you might be familiar with this venn
diagram from drew conway
which is where does data science fall
it's the intersection of these three
skills
called like hacking skills math and
stats knowledge and substantive
expertise
and we updated this a little bit for our
book although we didn't change
much which is you know those same three
basic areas programming databases we
call it domain knowledge instead and
math and stats
but we also wanted to highlight what are
the
areas of data science that are most
associated with you know the
intersections of these so i'm going to
talk more about
the difference between like analytics
machine learning and decision science
but i wanted to make clear so rather
than a venn diagram where you kind of
either have it or you don't that you
know these are all levels
right so you can have uh some people
could be
you know come from a computer science
background and have really in-depth
programming
uh knowledge whereas maybe some other
people come from statistics and are
really strong in that so it's not an
either or there's a big range of skills
that you can have
but what do you need to know to get that
data scientist job
i do think that you really need just
practically
in terms of like the availability of
positions to know either r
or python and this is going to be your
main language
day in and day out for doing things like
cleaning data
for making visualizations her writing
reports so on and so forth
but a lot of that data you'll need to
get from a sql database where it's
stored
and that's where sql comes in so sql is
a query language that fortunately
the basics of it you can pick up pretty
much in a weekend or less
and then you can go from there as you
need it and finally
we have git get if you're not familiar
with it is a version control system
and the reason you need this is twofold
one again just sort of practically it's
something that's very useful in the job
because what it allows you to do is
rather if you've ever uh
like saved you know word files and
you've been like draft one draft two
draft three draft ten because you wanted
those old versions in case you needed
something from them
git basically does this for you so
rather than saving every time you commit
it gives a snapshot of what your code
looked like at that time
so if you ever need to go back to it you
can there's a bunch of other benefits as
well but the second big one
is it's a great collaboration tool so
github is one of the places you can host
your code that you've saved with git and
it's a way that many open source
projects are done through github that's
how you can contribute code or file
issues uh if you're working on a data
science team that's how you could
collaborate on a project
so this is the third fundamental thing
you need to know on the programming side
and i'll add here at the end a lot of
people ask like well what should i learn
r or python this is a tough question
my first advice is python is
generally more common to see in job
descriptions so if you just want to go
off like what's the most likely thing
i'll have it's probably python
but r is more common in certain types of
positions so sometimes more analytics
positions or people coming from academia
so it's worth it if you have an idea of
what industry you want to work in in
data science or what type of data
science job
to take a look at those job descriptions
and see do they say
r do they say python do they say both
and if it seems like ah it's kind of
like either or some of
it is python some of it is r you know i
would try out both of them
and see what you like better but i would
definitely focus
at the beginning on just getting good at
one of them
rather than trying to get to a medium
level in both
all right so mathematics and statistics
i'm going to break this down into a
couple of parts
the first is knowing what techniques
exist so for example
if you're working at a company and they
say hey i need to group customers
together
you need to know that oh i should try
clustering that's a mathematical method
that can make groups from this data well
then you need to know
how to apply them so how do you actually
do a k-means clustering for example in
r of python but finally how do you
choose which to try
so there are many clustering methods and
rather than trying each one of them
you know if you know something about the
technique if you know that
what cases they work well and what they
don't work well in you can narrow down
pretty quickly and
figure out you know what technique
should i try and also some of the
intricacies of do i have to
normalize my data beforehand you know
all these other things of understanding
a bit
under the hood how it works
finally domain knowledge so i'm going to
take this diagram from renee
t on to describe domain knowledge which
is a core
job of most data scientists is to take a
business question
for example how can we split our
customers into different groups to
market to
and turn that into a data science
question so in this case like the
example i gave before
how can we run a clustering algorithm to
segment customer data
then you need to get the data science
answer so for example your clustering
found three distinct groups
but you can't stop there because that's
not very helpful to the business what
they want to hear
is something like hey here are three
types of customers
new high spending and commercial
for if you've been working for example
with kaggle competitions
they start at the data science question
right they start with here is a data set
you know predict this
thing um but most the time you're not
going to get something so clear-cut and
you're going to have to work with the
business stakeholder
to try to figure out what are they
actually trying to answer what are they
looking for
and things you need to do that
successfully include good communication
skills
empathy and understanding your data
which is huge so for example where
where can you find your data what are
some assumptions what are some edge
cases
and this is where you'll probably see a
lot of tweets about working with messy
data this is exactly about that
because in the real world uh just data
comes with so much mess
you don't know if you should go and try
to find another data set does another
one exist you do try to collect more
data so you're going to need to be
making these types of decisions
all right so that's a little bit about
what data science is what are some of
the core skills you need to be a data
scientist
great but how do you become one and i'm
actually going to say
all right what is like i disagree with
first which is that they're selling as a
fake data scientist
so i pulled these uh headlines just like
how can you spot a fake data scientist
20 questions for a fake data scientist
i just think this is total bs
gatekeeping and to not
let this dissuade you and to to make you
worry that
you know maybe because you don't have a
formal degree in data science or you did
a boot camp or whatever that you cannot
be a real data scientist because you can
and looking at these must-know lists so
these are like 20 things you need to
know
like honestly i don't know a lot of
these right i yeah i learned python once
upon a time i don't use it much anymore
i only worked with time series data
seriously and a couple months ago so
you don't need to necessarily know all
of these things
and i really like renee teat's tweet
here which is saying like hey
look here are some tools i use often
like sql python tableau
on jupiter but i never used r or neural
networks or natural language processing
and you'd find people say like oh that's
absolutely fundamental to being data
scientists
no i really think the skills i laid out
at the beginning like
you know some programming some math and
stats uh you know some domain knowledge
and communication skills is really what
you need to get started
and you learn the rest on on the way so
if you have a project come up where you
need to do
analysis of text you'll learn natural
language processing
or you'll learn image analysis or
tensorflow but there are plenty of data
science
jobs we don't need to use that and it
doesn't make you less of a data
scientist
for not knowing it or not using it
in this talk i'm going to go through
four ways that will help you find a data
science job the first
is creating a portfolio then we have
expanding your network
finding the right jobs and tailoring
your application
creating a portfolio so i define a
portfolio as a public body of work that
illustrates your data
science skills so how you can do that
is one of two ways is a diagram from our
book so you can start with a data set
that you find
interesting and find a question answer
or start with a question and find data
related to it to make an analysis
so let's look at some examples so a
great place to find data sets
is tidy tuesday this is a weekly project
it's was started in the art community
but these data sets are usually in csv
files so you absolutely can just
download them and work with them in
python
and as you can see there's data sets on
you know star wars on comic books on
bikes and this has been going on for a
couple years now
so i can almost guarantee you're gonna
find at least one data set
in here that's interesting to you and
worth exploring and this is nice because
it's you know it's relative
there's sometimes the data still messy
but it's available and there's
just it comes with a description or a
data dictionary so it's a great place to
get started
another ex and here we have some people
who've you know done this so this is
someone sharing a visualization
uh that they made about anime and manga
genres and someone looking at ages of
tennis champions so if you're looking
for some inspiration
you can see these people share it on
twitter with the tidy tuesday hashtag
so it's another reason to choose these
data sets because let's say you explore
it you can then look hey what did other
people who worked with this data set do
but you could also start with a question
instead
so this is a blog post about trump's
tweets
that started with a tweet
that came out which said every
non-hyperbolic tweet is from iphone his
staff every hyperbolic one is from
android
but this was essentially an assumption
from looking at some of the tweets and
how they differed
so what dave robinson wrote this posted
is he decided to analyze it so he did
some sentiment analysis
so he saw yes in fact the android does
have
you know more words that are on the
sadness scale or fear anger
and this actually was picked up um by
some news uh outlets and so what he
actually did before the sentiment is he
also showed look the pattern
of the android and the iphone's tweets
these are clearly different like how
they quote tweet when they tweet so on
it definitely looks like these are
different people
and we have seen trump tweeting on his
android so the other one must be the
campaign staff
so in this case there was a question and
so dave went out and
got used the twitter api to get the uh
you know backlog of tweets and to
analyze those
so some tips on when you do a data
science portfolio project
so you know what i've shown here is
these are blog posts or tweets with it
which i definitely recommend so after
you do the analysis
share what you learned and a great thing
to include is some visualizations
so this is jeff cow who at the time uh
that he did this project
was a meta student which is a boot camp
that i also went to
and he's looking he's using uh you know
natural language processing
to find to analyze these net neutrality
comments to find that
a lot of them the pro appeal were likely
faked and i really love this
visualization he chose because it might
not be an
obvious one but what he's showing is hey
look
i i didn't find that there were
identical exactly identical
uh messages but i found that there are
pretty much identical structures
and so he does the colors here so he
shows one messages americans as opposed
to the next one individual citizens as
opposed to
citizens rather than the scc you know as
opposed to washington bureaucrats as
opposed to watching bureaucrats so on
and so forth so i thought this was a
really cool visualization
and definitely think about how you can
catch people's attention at the
beginning
next choose a topic you're excited about
this is my old salmon
uh writing a blog post on whether python
users are more likely to get into
slytherin
don't feel that you have to uh you know
pick a project or
analyze something that you're like ah
i'm like interested in finance i guess i
do finance data like
find something that you like i you know
one of my projects was about uh pokemon
teams and what types i should have my
pokemon team because i was playing
pokemon
and i wanted to know uh so you know it's
less important what the topic is and
much more the kind of skills that you
can show as you did it so for example
showing that you
you know here's some code that you did
hey look i can get users i can write a
function and get users from twitter i
can do
some you know data filtering i can do
this like map function and per
so on and so forth my third tip
is limit your scope i really like this
quote from a blog post says
you know perfections can be a real
hurdle and next time i'm not going to
wait so long to push something out
because i think that last mile can be a
big barrier feeling like oh you know i
i could do one more thing or you know
what if my code isn't quite good enough
so
try at the beginning like it's okay if
you don't answer every question you have
about a data set maybe say hey i'm gonna
try to answer this one
question or i'm gonna try to make this
one visualization or i'm you know
i want to do this project because i'll
need to you know i have to get some data
from the web and so i'm just you know
i'm just going to get the data and i'm
going to publish how i got the data i'm
not going to worry about doing
anything with it and that's perfectly
fine and
it's definitely better to have something
out there than nothing
and on that point this is inspired by uh
same dave robinson trump his
uh our studio keynote which i definitely
recommend watching which is um
on the unreasonable effectiveness of
public work but
basically i used to think all right like
an analysis essentially it's getting
more valuable as i go
right i have an idea and then i get the
data and i clean it i explore and so on
and you know this this is true from your
own learning standpoint like you're
learning things along the way
but in terms of as part of your
portfolio as some work that you can show
someone when you're applying for jobs
it really you just need to get it out
there work on your computer is so much
less valuable than something that's on
github or
a blog or kaggle just something public
because it doesn't have to necessarily
be you go and tweet about it
but something that if you're in a job
interview you could say hey go to this
url or put on your resume here's where
my projects are hosted
so that someone can see it
and on that point you know this whole
process is getting it public by putting
it on github
and then writing a blog post about it so
putting it on github
i this is an example from as i mentioned
i went to medici my final project on
data science freelancers
and the helpful thing when you're
putting something on github is to write
a readme so to help people understand
hey what am i even looking at
so in this case i said uh this is a
project where i got information on 93
000 freelancers 3 000 jobs currently
and here's how the repo is organized
with these different scripts and what
each one of them does
and right as i mentioned this is also a
good way if you haven't used git or
github before
to practice those skills
on the blogging side well where do you
want a blog
there you can go with something like
medium or wordpress which has the
advantage of being easy and quick to set
up
you get some organic traffic on medium
if people search say
data science or the topic or your blog
post but
on the other hand there's less
customizability and control so for
example
i know medium seems like more things
have been going behind a paywall if they
decide that's what they want all
articles to do
you can't do anything about that on the
other hand
if you make your own website you really
do have all that control
so that's a big advantage it's always
going to be free
it does take a little longer to set up
but there are more tools that make that
easier i actually think uh
with fast ai also as a new tool i'm
working from github to publish a blog
um so i should add that here and you may
get stuck debugging issues so i've
definitely i use blog down personally
which is an r package
i've gotten stuck occasionally but
overall i like it because i'm in
complete control
it works very well with r and the other
advantage of it
is that if you are someone who really
wants to customize it you're like i want
this exact font i want this color scheme
i want this
there's a lot of themes that you can get
um pretty easily that you can then see
okay uh this uh type of you know theme
comes with these colorings but then you
can customize from there and this you
know the sky is the limit
so some things you can blog about once
you have your analysis well of course
you can explain it
right so this is someone explaining
their analysis from a tidy tuesday data
set about the gender wage gap in
australia
you could teach a concept so julia silke
here is showing
uh principal components analysis using
stack overflow data
this is a great thing if you say just
took a course on a statistical technique
or machine learning
write a tutorial about it show other
people how to do it write the thing that
you wish you had had at the beginning
because it would have made learning it
so much easier
or you can share your experience so in
this case there's a post on
our studio conference from danielle
vazquez who got a scholarship to go
and so if you attend a conference if you
go to a meetup talk that you really like
you can write about it
you can talk about what you enjoyed if
the talks were recorded
for conference say which ones you
recommend going to and so on
you can also give advice so this is a
blog post from
uh the new york about the new york r
conference from our ladies new york city
which had some speaker experience and
tips
or my co-author jaclyn knowles about
prioritizing data science work
so if you have been say working the
field or related field
and you want to give advice that's a
great thing to write a blog post about
and it may be faster than doing say a
whole analysis because you might already
have every all the advice you need in
your head or
think about the advice that people come
to you for how can you put that in blog
post and share with the world
so next we're going to talk about
expanding your network
this is rachel catman talking about the
difference um
this is research in kaggle about the
different ways that people already
employed the field
found their job versus those entering
the field and we see a big one about
employed in the field is recruiters and
friends families and colleagues
way more than those entering the field
and those are about
your network those are about who do you
know in case of friend and family and
colleagues but the recruiter is also a
personal relationship
so this is a really common way that
people get jobs
how do you build it though well you know
you're here tonight
um or this afternoon or in the you know
the in the early morning for folks in
certain time zones
going to a meet up that is one of the
advantages of covid
is that if you're in an area that is you
know say maybe you're in a rural area or
a small town there weren't any meetups
going on locally well
most meetups have moved online now and
some of them are doing
uh networking stuff before and after
or you can you know maybe you can meet
the speaker or other things like that so
see especially for some smaller meetups
uh you know
it and if you are someone who say like
lives in los
angeles and you hadn't been before to a
pilot's los angeles meet up
maybe think about going because even if
it has to be virtual for a while there's
still people local they're probably
working at local companies
and they can eventually help you out in
your job search
i'm a big twitter person probably a
little bit too much but i will admit it
definitely confused me at the beginning
how i use twitter is in a couple ways
the first is ask for help
and with that please use hashtags um
rather than
adding a specific person like adding
hadley wickham like it's definitely
understandable but the hashtag is great
because
people follow the hashtag so they can
retweet it they can see about answering
it so even if you don't have many
followers this is a good way to get
visibility and to get people
looking at your question so in this case
i asked about globally setting a color
scale for
ggplot2 and i got an answer and when i
did
i wrote a follow-up tweet saying like
hey think you know
thank you for this post on how to do
that so this is one thing you can use
twitter for
you can also live tweets talks so
pre-covet times this was me live
tweeting
uh our studio conference and also a
meetup and i sort of do this in two ways
like
one is to take notes for myself of some
of my big key takeaways
but the other is to share with people
who didn't get to go to the meetup like
what i think
that they could really learn and benefit
from so this is a nice way to take notes
for yourself and share some knowledge
and you can share your work so when you
do write that blog post when you do
publish that github repo share it
point people to it again you can use
hashtags um as a way if you don't have a
lot of twitter followers for more people
to see it
but this is you know i think writing the
portfolio the main point is not that you
get like hundreds of week
retweets or you get thousands of you on
your post it's more for the learning
yourself and to have that
available when you're talking and
interviews about projects you've done
but it is a nice bonus um if it can help
other people
and other people can benefit from it
you can share other people's work so i
enjoy tweeting about packages i find
useful papers again sort of this dual
benefit
of thanking the person who wrote it
showing that i appreciate it
making a note for myself and hopefully
helping other people discover it
now that's like sort of broader like
networking twitter but
what if you want to reach out to a
specific person that
you're interested in maybe because uh
some work that they do a blog post the
company they work on so on and so forth
i like this post from trey kazi which is
called do you have time for a quick chat
and what he does is he walks through i
first share is what is a typical message
he receives which i have here which like
hey do you have any time for
chat i'd love to pick your brain and he
shows how he would revise that
so the first thing is to mention the
work so tell them why are you reaching
out oh it's because i read this blog
post on data science interviews so this
shows like there's a reason you pick
this specific person which hopefully
there is
rather than saying mass messaging or
mass connecting with everyone on
linkedin
tell them why you're you're interested
in talking to them specifically
this also shows that you're going to
have questions that weren't answered and
things that were publicly written before
so for example if folks ask about you
know my job search advice often i'll say
hey i wrote some obviously wrote this
book which you have to pay money for but
i also wrote these free blog posts i
have these recorded talks
you know why don't you start there and
let me know if you have any follow-up
questions
second this person offers a topic so
they say hey i'm currently interviewing
and the part about whiteboard coding is
interesting i'd love to hear your
thoughts about whiteboard coding
questions and answers in my own
experience so this
lets them know you have a specific thing
you want to talk about rather than just
like
i just want to talk about everything
like you know my whole job search
and finally suggest a specific limited
time
so in this case could you spare 30
minutes on uh say tuesday or wednesday
because this gives one the person you're
reaching out to a better idea of what
kind of commitment this will be
and it shows them that you're not
necessarily expecting on their first
meeting with you to take
two hours of their time if you're
looking for people
to reach out to definitely check out
datahelpers.org by angela bassa
so she put out a call for folks who are
interested in helping
aspiring or junior data science people
or even some seniors with specific
problems
and people volunteered so i just took a
screenshot of some of the volunteers and
you can see some of them list
specifically
what they they can help with so for
example that you know public sector
government data or machine learning or
time series
in r so this is a really nice place
because these people have already said
that they're interested in helping out
and mentoring
a bit about their background what they
can do so i definitely recommend
starting with this list and you can
reach out and say hey i saw you on data
helpers
maybe see if they have blog posts other
public work if they don't you can just
say hey scion data helpers
um i would love to chat about your work
at a public library i
you know have so and so background and
this is very interesting to me
and then another tip from gordon
shotwell is
do try to be specific so for example he
says here how do i learn the basic
of neural networks versus how do i learn
statistics because
you know that's the distance question
it's so broad and there's so many ways
to learn statistics
and there's so many specific types of
statistics and it's like okay but what
so the first question kind of like what
do you want to use it
for and this is definitely like hard
when you're starting out in a field
because you're like i don't know
like i that's what i need you to tell me
is what statistics to learn
but if you can like you know you can
even ask that you could say hey
i'm very new to this field i don't
really know what area to start with do
you have a book recommendation
uh or something and that can get you
started and you'll be like okay i read
this book and then i want to learn
you know i got really interested in this
area let me learn some more and ask some
more people about that
finding the right job uh i do feel like
sometimes it's like i just want
you know a data science job like any
data sciences job but i do think it's
worth it to take some time and think
about like okay but what kind of job do
you want
and that job actually may not have the
data scientist title so this is jesse
moss pack we interview in chapter five
uh each chapter of our book uh we have
16 chapters has an interview with a
practicing data scientist or data
science manager at the end
and she says think about how attached
you are to the data scientist title
like if you decide to not concern
yourself with what you're called and
focus on the work that you're doing
instead
you'll have a lot more flexibility to
find jobs that's
really true especially as someone
starting out in the field
it is easier to get a related job
let's say a data analyst title or
program analyst or research and
evaluation specialist like i said at the
start there's so
many jobs that are data science related
that
also at another company might have the
data scientist job title for that exact
same job
so if if you're able to and willing to
i'm definitely recommend
being flexible and i talk about this in
this chapter but you know for example
just searching teams
terms like data and analysis rather than
i must have the data scientist title
but in data science there are a couple
of areas of specialties and so one
and i want to divide these into these
three categories that airbnb uses
because i really like it
the first is analytics so this is
uh sets here like defining monitoring
metrics creating data narratives
building tools
uh so this you know might be called the
data analyst at some companies but it's
basically
you know taking data that's there or
gathering it
and presenting it to people whether in a
report or in a dashboard
often you work very closely with product
teams or other teams to
help them with their analysis needs then
we have algorithms
you can also call machine learning so
this is about you know building and
interpreting algorithms that power data
products so this is i think maybe what's
a lot of people think of when they think
of data scientists is like the person
working on the amazon
you know recommendation algorithm that
pops up when you're looking at a product
page
and finally we have inference which
we've also called in our book decision
science
which is the really statistics part of
like establishing causal relationships
so for example
this would be someone working on the
microsoft experimentation team
you know trying to figure out all right
we run this uh a b test we you know show
half of people the old experience half
the new
we have these numbers about how it
performed but can we
infer from that you know how do we how
do we make sure it's not just noise and
confidently
infer that uh you know one is better
than the other
when you're looking at job descriptions
don't worry about meeting all of the
requirements
a lot of time they're wishlists and you
really only need to meet 60 or 70
of the core requirements so that does
mean for example if they say
you know we need someone with three
years of experience coding in python
if you've never coded in python or any
like any language at all
yeah you're probably not qualified for
that job but if you have two years of
experience coding it or
two years of professional and three
years in school even if they say three
years professional
you probably will be they'll be very
happy with you so don't
let the kind of job post looking for the
data science unicorn intimidate you
finally consider the types of companies
so
in our chapter two we lay out uh five
different example companies and of
course not all companies meet this
um but you know a fair amount of them
fall into it so for example you could
have massive tech you could have your
your google your facebook
you could have a startup you could have
like a midtech like lyft airbnb a
government contractor so on and so forth
and what i put here in this kind of
matrix is how those differ
along these axes of how much freedom do
you have
what's the salary like what's the job
security and
there's not a you know a best answer for
some people you may say you know what i
really value
job security and so i am fine if like
you know there's a little bit more
bureaucracy in my job the salary is not
quite as great
because at the end of the day like i
want to have job security and i want to
work more of a nine-to-five job so
you know i think like a government
contractor would be a great one or maybe
on the other hand you're like i
really love freedom i love moving fast i
want lots of chances to learn
and i don't care if there will be a
senior data scientist help me so maybe
you go to a startup
so there's nowhere to answer this but
you really want to reflect on what are
your needs and what are you looking for
in a company
so finally i want to talk about
tailoring your application
so writing a good resume this is an
example resume we share in our book and
there are a couple of things i want to
highlight and you definitely don't have
to use this exact format
but some of the things i like about it
are it includes your github and your
blog so if you put this work into making
a project portfolio you should share it
it uses clear and consistent formatting
so the color scheme is grey for most of
the things but
the title of the position or the major
is highlighted in green
the font stays the same and it's not
necessarily again like the color isn't
the same throughout this resume
but the same type of information always
has the same type of color
next embrace white space you don't need
to have a
super cluttered resume that packs
everything in
you can let it breathe a little bit
because it makes it a lot easier to skim
and limit it to one page now there are
exceptions to this so certain industries
might look for a longer resume if you
have 20 years of experience you're
switching a data scientist maybe you
need two
pages but you know most people i would
say you know
under 10 years you really can fit it
into one page how you can do that for
example is
you know focus more on the things that
are relevant if you had a job for five
years that's really not that relevant to
data science
you can just have one bullet point where
you describe it and devote more time to
the things you're more of or you can do
a column format and put some things on
the side
you can get creative but in general
again because people are not going to
spend that much time looking at your
resume
you want to make sure they can quickly
hone in on what's important
so for those bullet points try to
quantify your impact so rather than
saying you ran a b test on email
campaigns
say you conducted 20 a b tests on email
campaigns resulting in a 35
increase in click rate and a 5 increase
in attributed sales
so this quantifies both okay like how
much of something did you do
and then also what was the impact okay
if it i just wrote a conducted 20 a b
test
on email campaigns well a b tests aren't
valuable in and of themselves they're
valuable because
of you know the the results that they
can have showing you that hey this thing
this uh you know treatment is better you
should launch and your sales will
increase
so try to try to figure out okay rather
than saying just like i wrote this
report
you know like listing what's on your job
description what did it matter did it
increase sales for the company did it
like
you know decrease the amount of time it
took someone to do their job because you
automated something like really think
about like why would other people care
that i did this
and related to data science so you know
even if you don't have like a
data scientific analytics background
there's plenty of types of jobs that are
really relevant so for example
were you a teacher teacher or consultant
there you have communication skills
right
like you had classroom you know for
teaching and classroom management you
had to figure out
how to explain math to maybe you had an
ap class
uh for you know bc calculus but you also
had
you know math students who were you know
more remedial and so you had to figure
out how to tell your lessons
uh could did you work in the domain so
for example if you're a sales executive
maybe you could be a data scientist for
the sales team and that would be hugely
valuable to like
have been in that system know how to use
salesforce like know what sales
executives are thinking so on and so
forth
math and statistics you know what
classes have you done that are related
did you do any undergraduate research so
for example let's say you majored in
psychology what
did you take a psychology statistics
class did you do psychology research
where you had to do statistical tests or
data cleaning or data collection
really try to think all right how have i
used math and stats even if
the class wasn't necessarily or the
research wasn't called that
and finally programming and databases so
if you haven't worked in data science
have you used excel surveymonkey google
analytics tableau
sql any of these tools they're not all
tools some of them are tools you might
still use as a data scientist
especially sql but even if you never use
excel again you can talk about like the
projects that you did with and it shows
that you've worked with data even if you
use a different tool
and of course the personal projects that
we talked about with the portfolios
this a cover letter is not always
required but it sometimes is
and what you want here is first try to
find the hiring manager name if you can
so sometimes that's listed in the
position
uh sometimes you can look on linkedin if
it's a smaller company especially like
it's okay if you go two levels up so say
you're applying to a company and you
find a director of data
okay maybe they're not who's going to be
your manager but it still shows you did
research on the company
you know to try to figure out who would
be a relevant person and it shows that
you're tailoring to this company
next tie together your experience so
your cover letter should be a story
it's not just a repeat of your resume
but instead saying like okay how does
all this experience fit together
so give some examples of uh you know the
work that you've done
talk about a little bit more so you know
here you can read like prior to this i
was at boot camp i was an investment
consultant
like i took people to python i tailored
a curriculum so on and so forth
and focus on what you can offer to the
company so the company's not interested
in like oh this place would be a great
place to start my career
like or you know it's nice to say that
you love it and you research it but they
really care about like well what are you
gonna do for us why should we
hire you and what you want to show is
look i can solve a problem that you're
facing with this
experience that last point tailored to
the company
so if uh you know for example it's in
let's say you multiple
projects and one of them's i don't know
like
related to web data you know website com
web
companies that you're applying to maybe
use that project because that's going to
be more relevant to them
so i want to close out by doing a brief
recap of some of the takeaway points
so first you don't need to know
everything don't let yourself get
paralyzed by these must-know lists or
all these things you can learn data
science or all the millions of courses
because
no one knows everything you don't need
to know everything to do
you know a great thing at your job and
you'll always be learning so don't let
that hold you back
there's no such thing as a fake data
scientist
i i just really don't like this point um
you know
of there being a fake data scientist no
you know if if you
data science is a broad enough umbrella
for us all
but that being said you may want to let
go of the data scientist title because
there's
so many positions where you've been
doing interesting data science work
that may not have that title for
whatever reason and will also honestly
have less competition for those jobs
so maybe that's something you want to
have eventually but for your first job
try to focus more instead on like okay
what can i learn how can i gain
experience and not so much what i will
be called
so when you're applying a job remember
to focus on creating a portfolio
to one help yourself learn and to show
off your skills
to expand your network to find the right
job
not just any job and to tailor your
application
and so with that i want to thank
everyone for coming and i'm going to
take questions in a minute
if you enjoyed this talk you can find
some data science career related posts
and some other
data science topics on my blog hooked on
data.org
you can also find me on twitter at
robinson underscore yes
like i said this is all covered in the
book with a bunch more stuff uh that's
available at datacycareer.com
and you can get 40 off with mtp
umbrella 20. thank you
yes and i am open to answering questions
as soon
as i can remember how to not cheat there
we go
how to stop sharing great
so do you want to read the question yeah
that would be helpful
okay so the first one that had five
upvotes is
how um different is a data analyst role
from a data scientist role
ah great question so
this is hard because a couple reasons
one is there's definitely disagreement
about this so some people
divide it as it's about the tools that
you use so like a data analyst will use
a graphical user interface something
like tableau or excel
whereas a data scientist uses scripted
language like r or python
other people say it's about the type of
problems that you tackle so i just
listened to the super data science
podcast with uh krill
and he said he divides it as a data
analyst is determining the exact term
it's basically doing like descriptive
analytics about the past what's happened
before
and a data scientist is doing predictive
what's going to happen
and some uh also some analysis of what
would be prescriptive what should we do
based on that so that's another way
so there's all these different ways to
divide it and the other problem is
what it means that companies vary so
much so there's a good blog post from
lyft about how they changed all of their
data analysts to be data scientists and
their data scientists to be research
scientists two years ago
etsy where used to work did a similar
thing whereas previously the data
analyst team we were working we were
using r and python and stats and you
know doing some uh you know even some
machine learning but we were
embedded with uh um you know sort of
uh other teams and basically we said we
did data for
data science for human consumption the
data scientist team was about working on
the ad algorithms or the search ranking
algorithms so they did data science for
machine consumption
but then since i left they changed their
title to data scientists so
really it's so different from out from
company to company
but in terms of looking at positions
with a data analyst
what i would look out for is finding a
position
where you can use r or python and
there's some
also you know some like stats or math or
something that you can do in there
um as well but really just studying it
but on the other hand you know if you've
never worked with data before maybe you
just want to start out with like
you know i just want to start working
with data it's okay if it's in excel
it's okay if it's google analytics like
it'll just get me comfortable
okay the next question is what red flags
should you look out for
when interviewing for a data scientist
i'm just laughing because i don't i
don't think this was planted but
jacqueline and i before wrote the book
actually
actually published a blog post called 12
red flags in
data science interviews that you should
look out for as a candidate uh
so that's on my blog definitely feel
free to check that out
uh i'll just highlight a few i think one
of the biggest ones
is data engineering so is there data
available
is there any data is there a data
engineering team um
you know have they done the work to make
the data available or
are you going to spend your first year
basically being a data engineer and
building a data warehouse
now that could be fine if that's what
you want to do but you should know that
going in
uh and the second thing i'll say is if
you're starting out as a data science
test i think most folks should try to go
to it
to a team where there's already an
established data company where there's
an established data science team
rather than being the first or the
second data scientist because that way
you'll get more mentorship you'll learn
more best practices
but there's a bunch more like i said so
feel free to check out the blog post
okay the next one is from cecily and it
is
is it absolutely necessary to have a cs
mathematics background to start a career
in data science
yeah it's definitely not absolutely
necessary um i mean it's some
like at some point you will need to pick
up some of those skills
right like at some point you know you
whether that's coursera or doing a boot
camp
uh but you definitely i know people who
were in terms like their formal
education in college i
know someone is like an english major
you know lots of people with a social
science
major so maybe did a few stats classes
but definitely not a math or a computer
science degree
so you really don't need to and
don't forget uh and don't think of that
as a negative
so as i was talking about when you're
thinking about on your resume
how to you know tailor how you talk
about your previous positions to data
science like that's not just saying like
to like trick the hiring manager
into hiring you like you truly think
about like you know liberal arts
education learning to communicate
learning to write well maybe learning to
do presentations that's hugely important
a social sciences background is all
about doing research
like that's my background very similar
to the data science uh process
so you definitely don't need to have uh
that background but i will say
that is one of the places where a
project portfolio is more helpful
uh like if you're someone who's like you
know i have a data science degree i have
a math degree at computer science
you know maybe you don't need a project
portfolio you did enough relevant
projects in undergraduate people tell
from your resume
like you have very relevant work
experience but if you don't have
if your resume doesn't right now show
the data science skills that you have
a portfolio can be really helpful for
that
okay the next question is from sammy and
um question is hello emily i just
graduated from medici
questions are i seriously suffer from
serious
imposter syndrome do you have some tips
on how to get rid of imposter syndrome
oh god uh i wish i so one
definitely check out uh caitlyn houdin's
post on and
let me actually just pull it up really
quickly so i can post it in the chat
on imposter syndrome because it's a
great it's a really great post
um and so it highlights a couple thing
which is first like part of the reason
imposter syndrome is so easy to fall
into in data science
is because it's a new field says
poaching makes in the post new field
it's a combo of other fields
it's constantly expanding uh so you have
all these things right where it's like
well
you have a data scientist so i need to
give computer science and also stats and
i need to communicate and like i also
need to do this other thing
and you know you're probably never going
to be as much an expert as someone who's
just focused in that so that's hard
there's always new technologies so even
if somehow magically you learned
everything about data science right now
uh you're you know two years from now
there'll be a new technology and so you
won't know everything anymore so that's
one of the reasons i think it's so
common and what
uh caitlyn says she does to deal with
this is just like try to remember like
you know what what she does know so
accepting that you can't know everything
but that's okay but i do know things
other people don't like i've built these
predictive models i've you know
uh you know learned to do machine
learning models in production like
remember what you do
know and how valuable that is so that's
been some helpful for me but
i think the other thing honestly is
having a
community that will help support you um
so i've you know i've had people i
mentioned a little bit about working at
mattis there are
some random people on the internet
mostly on reddit where you don't have
your real name who are like
a bootcamp graduate can never be a real
data scientist essentially
like as bootcamp education just can't be
and you know i i want hopefully some
point i'll get the point where like i
can just be like nope you know i'm
secure in myself i
you know will not this doesn't bother me
at all but it did bother me but one
thing that helped was like talking to
other data scientists that i know
um and that really helped me is like yes
there's some
internal work you need to do but also
there is something nice like turning to
friends turning to former colleagues who
are like what are you kidding you
you did great work on that project like
you did all these things like you're so
valuable
so that at least has helped me because
the community also reminds you when you
talk to these people when you get to
know like that data scientist at airbnb
or like these other things you admire
you gotta know oh wait they don't they
don't know everything either
you know they also have doubts they are
people too and i think that can really
help uh break down this image of some of
these folks on twitter that they always
feel confident that they know everything
that no one ever criticizes them
because when you get to know them you're
like hey no these are actually people
that i can relate to on a personal level
great thanks so one person asked three
questions but i do want to give other
people a chance so i'll come back to
that person
once we get through them um um
sushmita asked do companies value data
science certifications from moocs like
coursera edx and udemy
i depends on the company uh
like i saw um google was saying they
come out with like a career
certification that they said they would
count the same as a four-year college
degree and i think one of them is like
data analytics
so i guess in that case yes um
i would say more so i think it
you can keep it on there it can be like
like a nice little plus like cool
they're continuing to educate yourself
it's probably not enough to get you the
job
or even to get you necessarily the
interview right because i think some
folks still have doubts
you know compared to like a four-year
college degree they're like oh well like
you know could they have cheated because
they have just watched his lectures
passively so i think much more effective
is taking that knowledge that you learn
in the course and applying it in
a project so i don't think it will hurt
but i don't necessarily think it's going
to be
a big factor in deciding whether to
interview or hire you
okay sorry about that i had to close the
window the sirens were very loud
um in new york um a lounge
i i don't know if i'm pronouncing the
name um correctly
asks uh do you have any specific advice
for people who are switching
careers yeah i mean i think
so pretty much everything i said in the
talk like applies right some of it a
little more so like i mentioned earlier
like project portfolios might be
especially helpful
um but i really do think two things one
you know with this like let go of the
data scientist title like it depends
like how far away was your previous
career right is your previous career
software engineer which is like pretty
adjacent to data science or
was it a i don't know art historian at
the met which like
is pretty unrelated in terms of domain
uh although you know again you have
think
but in that case thing about
communication skills like what can you
bring
and how can you maybe start doing data
as part of your job now so
i don't really know much about art
historians but like can you
analyze some data can you you know post
make a blog post about like you know
some of the works or like some
history of art and like show a
visualization of how that changed over
time so
if you think about switching careers try
to find ways can you incorporate
data analysis data science into your
current job
um and if at all possible because that
can be
a really good way when you're you know
talking in job interviews or writing on
your resume that you can be like yes i
know this sounds like an unrelated
career but actually look i found this
way to do data i got these communication
skills
um just really think about how you can
frame what you're doing as something
relevant to the field
right the next question is from juan who
asks for someone trying to switch
careers
into data science is a masters in data
science a good idea or are there better
ways to get into the industry
so we have we write it all right so
chapter 3 is
on exactly this which is like how do i
get the skills to be a data scientist
um i think masters is one way
the downside is the cost in terms of
like the actual
monetary cost and also the opportunity
costs right so if you're doing a
full-time master's you probably can't
work so you're not earning a salary for
that time
the other thing with data science
masters specifically is you really want
to
be thoughtful and um
and picking the school because there are
some good programs out there but they're
all relatively new
right like none of them really existed
before five years ago uh and some of
them are just trying to cash in on this
phase uh
and will be taught you know maybe
they'll be teaching like outdated
technologies or none of the professors
have worked in industry or they just
cobbled together
like these statistics these computer
science courses without actually like
making it a uh you know curriculum that
goes together
so how you can sort of tell that is
definitely look at the syllabus
if you know some folks in data science
like you reach out to them uh
talk what they think about it also
really ask and look at the alums like
what are people
who graduated from this program doing
how will this help you find a job
so it's one way the other a couple ways
we cover
are you could uh do a boot camp um
and you can learn on the job so like i
talked about the art store and how can i
use data on my job
or third you can self teach right you
can do online courses and things like
that
so if you want to learn more definitely
check out chapter three but that's sort
of my short bit on data science masters
okay um this next question
that i really like is what is the best
part and worst part of your current job
uh so yeah so i i
i think um i'll actually say look kind
of it's it's a
twofold thing of kind of like in in some
ways like the same thing being in some
ways the best and the worst which is
uh i now work on a centralized team of
data scientists so previously
at etsy i reported to another well at
that time another data analyst but
i was embedded with the search team so i
was in their slack channel i was in
their meetings
uh you know they were the people who
were kind of like day to day like
telling me like you know what are some
things that i should work on
and then at my last company i reported
to
the vice president of growth so i was
fully embedded in the growth team which
was running experiments
and now at warby parker the data science
team is centralized so we're like a
small data science core team
and we work with different departments
usually for a couple months at a time
so that's been something that's been
really exciting because you know we get
to have an impact
on lots of different departments but
it's also you know sometimes
i miss like being working really closely
with another team like getting to know
them at you know individually really
well really getting to know that problem
space
versus you know more of like a couple
months like deployment working on one
specific project
uh so i don't think you know that's
something also to think about when
looking at data science jobs you can
definitely ask about them they may use
different terminologies but the two
things to look for essentially are
will you report to another data
scientist or to
you know like the head of the e-commerce
team
and uh are you going to be mainly
working with one team or does your team
you know work with lots of teams and
you'll switch maybe every couple months
okay uh the next question is for um
our is from artemis um related questions
are cecily what are good resources for
brushing up on statistics
probability and other math topics
necessary for data science
yeah so i'm going to post uh one link
here so naked statistics
is a really good um
introductory like especially if you have
very little background in statistics
it's like a great like very friendly
like no there's not a lot of equations
it's more about how do i think about
statistics like what do these terms mean
um so that's a good place to get started
and then the other one i recommend
is introduction to statistical learning
so this is like
a very classic book uh in the field it's
also
available for free online uh there is
code in r that's included along with it
but even if you're
learning python you can i don't know if
you want you could try to translate the
code but you could also
uh you know just focus most of the book
is not about the code it's about the
concepts
uh and i really think if you you know
just go through that book and learn that
pretty well that
is you know pretty much all the
statistics and machine learning you need
to get started
okay the next job is the next question
the next question is from
gia wu the current job market is still
competitive every ds job exam's job has
thousands of applications
is building connection and getting to
this recruiter getting to the recruiter
the only way to get through this
[Music]
so it depends on the company right so i
would not say necessarily every data
science job as thousands of applications
because like a small startup that most
people haven't heard of is probably not
getting a thousand applications
but yes like well pre-covered times i
would say airbnb although of course
they've had to lay off people and have a
hiring freeze but like
you know google uh you know all the kind
of like big names like yes
those do actually have thousands of
applications and it's true like the
really
the main way that people get that is
through a referral so through someone
that already works there that you know
you've maybe worked with them before
or potentially you get by reaching out
or knowing the recruiter
so that's why i would say like maybe
don't start with those companies but
look at like okay what are some smaller
companies what are some local companies
you know if you
don't live in new york city or san
francisco you know you might also have
an advantage there like i don't know
you're in
uh nashville is not that small city but
like you know a city like nashville
where yes on the one hand there are
fewer data science jobs but on the other
hand you know they're
less competition there's less people
vying for them uh so i do think
yes most the time uh for these really
prominent companies
uh some of them do like the ones in the
middle like i think etsy when i was
there did look at every resume that came
through at least skimmed it
but some companies do have automated
systems
that you know narrow down these thousand
resumes based on keywords to the
100 that a uh recruiter will look for
and sometimes they do employ some rules
of thumb like okay
if it's a new grad position this is your
gpa
or you have to be from the schools or
you have to have this major
um and so in that case yes i do think
like
having those connections is always going
to be really really helpful
but it's possible and people do get jobs
especially at smaller companies
by applying on their website
the next question is from wasilla if
you're already good at either python or
r would it be a plus to learn the other
language
as well i think
it's a plus if you're finding jobs that
you're interested in
that use the other language yes um
right because you you can definitely
start that job you know you i i know
people have gotten jobs who've been very
experienced in one language and they've
gotten jobs that will use the other
because they basically said like look
i know i'll do all these things in r um
you know i started learning python
and i'm confident that i can get up to
speed and like do this like great work
that you want to hire me for
and do it in python um but if you're
just like i don't know i just like
you know yeah i'm happy with the
language i have i just randomly kind of
want to know the other one
i think probably not i would focus more
on um
getting good at the your main language
and if needed there's
a lot of tools coming out to make r and
python work really well together
so for example um there's reticulate for
r so if there is something like okay i
want to use r for most things but
there's this python package that i
really want to use for this specific
model
you can just use it for that part right
so you do all of your your data
gathering and your data cleaning
uh you know and data munching and then
do this python package for the machine
learning model
and then you use r again for
visualizations and report writing so
that's also an option so maybe
if if there's something you're like i
know our i know the other language has
this tool that i really want that
doesn't exist in mine and i want to
learn it that could be a good reason to
learn the other one but i wouldn't just
say like oh i just
you know it's better to learn both i
would i would more stick to one unless
you have a good reason to learn the
other one
the next question is um from
luke is there any specific advice you
would give
someone coming out of college for
breaking into the field tips for getting
interviews with
very little professional experience yes
so the first thing is definitely look
for positions that have
new grad so some of the bigger companies
will have this where it'd be like
specifically for recent college
graduates
second is data scientist is becoming
more of a title
uh for people with at least a few years
of work experience even if not
necessarily as a data scientist say as
like a data analyst or a software
engineer
so again that's sort of like maybe
letting go of the title like some
companies just don't
hire junior data scientists they don't
hire entry level they hire
data analysts for that role uh or other
things like that
um and then finally uh
if you can if your school that you
graduate from has a career
resources center like definitely go to
that um you know ask them for help with
your resume a lot of them will do this
for free if you're a recent grad
uh and reach out on linkedin to people
who've graduated from say your same
major
um or you know who just wanted your
career that you're interested and say
hey i'm a recent graduate from you know
x university which this person also went
to you know i saw that you're
you know a data scientist at this
company i'm really interested in the
field i majored in this
uh you know would you have time to 30
minutes to chat
you don't recognize especially in these
times like for example parents of young
kids just
may not have a lot of extra time but
there are lots of people who like
helping people and also maybe
especially like new graduates especially
someone they have a connection to
even if that connection is just that you
graduated from the same school
okay the next question is from shop
thank you for your wonderful
presentation i was interested in what
your suggestion would be in regard to an
individual
who has no prior tech experience but
wants to progress into the data world
what program would you suggest starting
with
yes so i would so i would suggest
um so there's lots of different options
here but i would maybe start out with
reading
i'm also going to post this in the chat
uh
if people feel free to chime in if you
have python resource like i said i'm
more of an r person but like
let's start with the r for data science
book which is available for free
online uh you know start looking for
that i really like it because
um for example python like there are
some for this but there are a lot of
i wouldn't necessarily start with just
like learn python because they're going
to talk about things that aren't
that relevant to data science versus r
for data science is like start by
visualizing data which is like yes i
want to visualize data
um so if you have no prior experience
i'd start with like okay first
let's try something out and let's try
you know radar for data science there's
some built-in
uh data sets in r and so just try like
oh
okay here's this bolted data center in
cars how would i find which car has the
most miles per gallon
okay how would i narrow it down to just
the cars that have you know this
much uh you know this many cylinders so
on and so forth
and because you want to start i would
say like before you necessarily say oh i
do a masters or a bootcamp i put a lot
of money in time like
start trying it out start seeing as even
if your job's not tech related is there
any data around right is there like
anything you can do that's related or if
not can you like start moving
that way and if you know again if not
like try practicing it in your free time
uh and look for a community of other
people so like r for data science for
example has an online community of
learning it has a slack channel that can
be another nice place to just find other
people
who are going through the same thing as
you okay
the next question is from eliana which
is what's a good way to practice
sql skills that employers love you
yeah so it's funny i call it sql that's
the other like debate is it sequel or is
it sql is it
uh data or data um so
sql skills so more so sql i would say
you don't so much need like a project
that shows you use sql
um like versus like it's helpful i have
a project that shows like are a python
instead um you know lists on your resume
you a lot of companies have
sql technical screens so that's going to
be how they test like whether
you know sql and so you know it's more
about like that's where you're going to
like prove it so it's more about
okay how do i get those skills to pass
that technical interview so there's a
bunch of sql tutorials online
honestly like i would focus on there's
not a kind of advanced one but i
wouldn't really
worry about it that much like uh i'm
gonna post like w3
sql schools that's a great one to start
again all three
uh and yeah this is a great place to
start and just learn things like okay
how do i
uh filter a sql table how do i do some
like string manipulation how do i join
that's mostly the stuff that's going to
come up
and you can look uh you know if you also
google like sql interview questions
um you'll get some like good example
questions that you might
uh face like we have a few in our book
as well
the next question is from aditi um what
is the most
effective way to transition your career
from
data analytics focus to more inference
based
something that companies are more fun
more comfortable calling a data
scientist
hmm that's a good question uh
so i think i think there's probably a
twofold approach this which is one like
do you feel that you have the skills
already so for example like
maybe you have a statistics background
you just haven't used it in your job
or you've taken some online courses uh
or you've you know read textbooks
so if you don't feel you have those
skills yet i would definitely kind of
start there
um you know and read up on and build
those skills uh and then but
once you do feel like that i think
that's honestly something i would talk
to your manager about
i think first the question is is there
area
in your current job where you could use
inference skills right is there area
would be more
stats focused because maybe there is and
that could be a great place to start
or maybe it turns out they're like you
know what no like we really just don't
we don't need it
um if that's the case you can see like
if your own judgment is maybe like
actually they say this but i really
think a model here would be useful
um you know maybe try that you know on
on your
either on your own time or if you have
some extra time during your day
and present that to them and say like
hey i know like you know i
i thought this you know i came up with
this idea i thought it was really
valuable what do you think
um or if there's really just nothing at
your job uh i think it is sort of a
process of looking at other jobs
and to show you're qualified for that
job the first thing is one also your
analytics experience will be uh
will be relevant so even more inference
jobs you're still doing a lot of like
analytics work
uh you know my like author jacqueline
has a blog post you're not paid to model
which is like modeling is the last step
of this very long
process of like getting the data talking
to people you know cleaning it so on and
so forth
so even in those jobs your skills will
be very useful uh
and to show that you're prepared for
them again part of it's going to be an
interview or a take-home assignment
so uh you know if you're applying to
those jobs you get to that stage um
you know practicing almost take home
assignments like seeing how you're doing
okay are they asking you something and
you're like oh i thought i could do this
but actually they're asking for this and
like i'm really like not comfortable
with
understanding my outputs or you know
making a recommendation from it then
it's maybe time to go back to building
those skills uh so i think it's really
coming down to kind of pinpointing
all right what what are these kind of
steps to getting that job uh
what's the what's the next point how do
i keep building towards that
are you okay to answer more questions
yeah
okay all right uh the next question is
from neely which is
how general do you go in your linkedin
profile
well the general advice is to tailor
your resume to the company it seems
difficult to do that on your public
linkedin as well
how general is it yes it's definitely
yeah i don't uh in terms of me i haven't
really like taylor to anything
um definitely i think much more
important with your linkedin profile
along with just you know have the basic
information about where you worked all
that good stuff
is to have those resume bullet points um
and where for example you focus on
quantifying it you're showing your
impact
uh you could also think about like what
i do with medicine i like it
i think i do this on my linkedin and i
give like a little explainer of like
what medici is in some of my projects
the nice thing about linkedin is you
don't really have to worry about space
like i wouldn't do
20 bullet points for a job but maybe you
can do four
instead of the two you had to limit on
your resume to wake at one page
so i wouldn't you could tailor it as
much
at you know your summary maybe if you're
like pretty much all the jobs i'm
looking for are gonna be in the
financial
uh industry or they're gonna be very
analytics folk
focused jobs you know you can put that
in your summary um but that's something
where it's like
you're not so much tailoring to a
specific company as telling people what
types of companies and positions you're
interested in
okay so again with the questions i'm
sort of skipping over some just to get
people who haven't
asked a question to ask their question
first so susanna
asks how do you assess what is doable
for one person and how do you figure out
what percentage of your time is spent on
each period
of the project life cycle so doable for
one
okay versus i guess like a team um
hmm that's a good question i think
so i'm guessing this is like asking
about like at an edit company not like
your personal portfolio project
um so yeah if you're at a company
uh i think one is like our team has been
thinking a lot about like doing that
scoping when you start the project and
uh so we have in our book uh chapter 10s
on making
uh making an effective analysis and one
of the things we recommend is making an
analysis plan
so making a document that you agree with
your stakeholder of these are the
questions i'm going to answer like here
are the overarching ones like and here
are some specific things i'm going to do
to answer that question
because what that can help with is it
just limits the scope and you agree with
your stakeholders
they sign off on it and if you get to
the end like sometimes like oh you know
we try these things but i couldn't find
the answer to this question
or you know it turns out this isn't
feasible i can be really easy for them
to be like just you know just keep
digging just pull in this other data set
just pull that thing
you'll be like okay you know but we need
to re-talk about this and maybe this
would be phase two of this project and
re-scoping it because you know we agreed
to this part of the work
and also you know and we have different
we have we're juggling multiple
priorities here
so that's one thing i find helpful in
terms of like one person versus multiple
um i think that really depends on your
team
structure uh so at uh
data camp like i was the only that was
my last company i was the only data
scientist on the growth team but i could
get help from the chief data scientists
or other people
but at etsy there were other there are
two other analysts working on the search
team
so i think that's like much more of an
individual like working with your
your manager type thing and a little bit
of trial and error because sometimes you
start projects and you're like this is a
lot more work than i thought it was when
we scoped out it would take a month
let me revisit this my manager and if
needed the stakeholders
okay um the next question is from carlos
regarding the process of analyzing data
at work what's the most
important confidence you do you think
someone
making a career change should develop
for example
this meaning data visualization versus
so i think this uh it does depend
somewhat on your job
um like what type of data science
position i do think
you need to be able to like make a full
like
simple but a full simple analysis
yourself so you need to be able to take
some messy data
to tidy it like maybe that's a little
string manipulation maybe that's making
a new column
you need to visualize it you need to
like make that into little reports like
a very but like i mean like a very
simple not like oh this is a really
complex data set but you do need to be
able to do that full cycle
in terms of like okay great i kind of
have this baseline like which should i
develop more i think honestly it's like
some of your interests like i know some
people are data visualizations expert
like maybe you want to go work as
at a newspaper and be a data
visualization person and that you might
need to learn d3 to make interactive web
visualization so maybe that's what you
go down or you're like i'm gonna go work
at this
company that i really want to work at a
small company and i know they may not
have a lot of data engineers so i need
to work more on like making the like the
etl
extract transform load process i really
want to work on like okay how do i take
data and like make it into a usable
format
so i don't think that necessarily like
one is the right answer but you do want
to make sure
that you have that that baseline of
being able again like
it doesn't have to be like you know the
most complicated thing i can deal with
you know 50 million
you know road data sets by making an aws
like you know spinning up an aws cluster
but you should be able to do
like a full analysis from getting and
cleaning the data to presenting the
results
that's um that's that's good advice
daria asks which r sql package have you
tried or would you recommend or
is it better to stay with sql itself
so the engineering process yes
uh so i love dbplier um so dv
player you can write dplyr code it gets
translated into sql you just have to do
like a little
setup thing at the at the top to uh like
connect it to the sql database
for interviews though i would spend some
time like learning
sql uh now fortunately with in r if
you're using dplyr like the concepts are
very similar you just have to be like oh
it's not a filter it's a where
um you know but left joins the same like
all that stuff uh but i would spend some
time learning sql
like again sort of these basics joining
where and also one of my favorite things
called common table expressions so for
the interview itself
yes depending on your job you may end up
doing like i did
at datacamp like all of your your sql uh
using dbplier in r
and writing our code or most of the
yeah all right the next question is from
tiwa which is do you think a masters is
beneficial to advance your data science
career to management
i like i guess i'm guessing it's like a
master like stats or computer science or
data science
honestly probably not like a lot of ways
that people go into management
is often there's an opening they're
working as a data scientist at a company
and there's an opening on their team so
maybe a manager left maybe the team is
growing it needs a manager
and you kind of raise your hand for it
that you're interested in in it
and the types of skill you need in
management like
yeah it some companies managers still
like stay fairly technical
and do their own data science projects
but other companies like
honestly like it's not so much your data
science skills there might be a
technical lead like when people need
mentorship
on like r or python and your job is a
lot more like okay
let me uh mentor mentor the team in
their
you know communication skills and
scoping out projects i will help give
them cover i will work with the
other like you know the broader company
to figure out what we should be working
on and like
those types of skills are not things
you're going to learn in a data science
master's program
so you know that's there's always
exceptions maybe there are some
there i could definitely believe there
are some companies where they're like
nope we require a formal master's degree
in the field to be in management
but most companies i would say that's
not necessary
the next question is from merdad which
is
when we reach an interview meeting with
a data scientist team what type of
questions are more important for them
for example for a company working in
mining and maintenance field i heard
they may give us a hack-a-rank
challenge yeah so that's uh
the hard part is kind of what you're
hitting on there is that the data
science interviews there's just so many
questions that they could ask oh my god
you could be asked to like
you know some super like mathematical
like derivatives of something
or you could be asked this like hacker
rank or a leak code question and so on
and so forth
and you know you hit on something like
you might be able to predict that a
little bit based on the industry based
on the type of job like if you're
looking for a machine learning position
you're more likely to get these like
algorithm questions like lead code
questions if you're looking for a
decision science very stats heavy
inference position
you're more likely to be on the stat
side but really i think the best way is
if you're getting you know if you if you
you know send your resume in you got a
call with a hiring manager they're like
we want to
you know let's say maybe it's after the
take home want to bring you on site is
ask like you could absolutely ask the
recruiter
or the hiring manager hey like you know
what what should i be preparing for for
these interviews and they're not going
to tell you the question
but a good hiring manager interview
recruiter will say like oh okay you know
your first 30 minutes you'll be
you know working with uh emily on sql
code and you know you know writing sql
and the next one will be a case study
you know with
our product manager and the next one
will be you know uh
you know our exercise with uh this
uh engineer so on and so forth so you
can
definitely ask look on glassdoor if it's
a bigger company if they've hired data
scientists before
uh they might have uh the data science
questions there
but yeah unfortunately it is uh you know
maybe you can ask them reddit you can
ask on twitter
like hey i'm interested in this industry
is anyone an experience with this
industry no like what types of questions
they ask but yeah it's it's such
a variety and that's also why if you
don't progress in an interview
like don't don't think like all this
means i'm never gonna be cut out for
data scientists like think about like
you know give yourself an ost review and
be like okay like yeah i sort of froze
up because yeah i'm really good at our
code but i kind of forgot how to write a
for loops let me practice that i might
come up again but also
you know just because you couldn't
answer this like random like invert a
binary tree computer science question
it doesn't mean it will come up in
another interview it doesn't mean you're
not equipped to be a data scientist
the next question is from tiffany how
did you decide you wanted to do data
science
yeah so a little bit about my background
so i'm also going to post this
uh interview i gave right after i
started at etsy
i'm gonna post in the chat uh but yeah
so i was
in a phd program in organizational
behavior
uh in the social sciences that's
basically psychology and sociology
applied to work
and i realized hey i don't really want
to go into academia so i decided to
leave with my master's degree after two
years but then it's like well now what
do i do
and data science appealed to me because
it had a lot of the
similar process to social science
research especially quantitative social
science research so
coming up with a question like
investigating past research on it
gathering data whether through an
experiment or an
archival data set uh you know analyzing
it presenting it to
your advisor who knows a ton about this
field but also to this qualitative
researcher who like has
you know never heard of this technique
or this uh domain you're in
and how do you communicate that so like
it was similar enough in that way which
is great
um but then the other part uh that
you know brought me to data science was
what i liked about was the immediate
impact that it could have so in academia
you might write a research paper
one it could take seven years to publish
two you publish it and maybe no one ever
reads it or benefits from it versus
working in industry at a company and
data science
i really like this like i'm working with
teams to solve their problems
uh you know i'm gonna be able to help
them and use these skills that i've
learned i
you know i minored in statistics and
like you know maths and programming and
r
i learned as part of my undergraduate
continued in
uh grad school i can use this to uh
you know to help people so that's really
what drew me drew me to data science
okay the next question is from bharati
trying to make career changes
what courses you suggest to make a start
yeah so i think this is uh you know
really
dependent on kind of what you need the
most of so for example
did you come from you know one of like
either computer science or stats or
you're like no i didn't come back
you know again i was a liberal arts
major i don't have any of that so where
do i start
um honestly there was so i recommend
like introduction to cisco learning as a
book
i i'm not as good at answering this
because i do have more of that formal
background so i've picked i've
definitely learned a lot on my own but
it's mostly been
sort of contained like oh i need to
learn time series let me find the time
series textbook
or you know i need to learn how to
handle this type of data
in r so let me take this course so i
don't fortunately don't necessarily have
like a great
recommendation for you but i think the
important thing is to
try to find something uh
you know fight think about how you learn
best like there are some interactive
courses uh
you know online like do you would you
like to do that or you're coding in the
browser or
are you someone who could you know just
listen to a video an hour a video
lecture and like take notes so
think about like how how you can learn
best uh
you know will help you figure out like
what types of courses
okay the next question is from lauren
can you say more about your experience
at metis
yeah so i did metis uh back in
uh summer of 2016 so right after i
finished
uh my masters and yeah i enjoyed it it
was a good fit for me
so basically i had the statistics i had
the r knowledge but i wanted uh
to learn some more like machine learning
to learn some python
and also to have some time to learn git
and github and build a project portfolio
so i enjoyed metas because that's what
metas is built around so you have about
two hours of uh
like course during the day but then the
afternoon is all about working on your
own project and that starts out like
pretty
structured so it's like okay work with
the imdb data set to make
these predictions about movie ratings
but by the end of it
it's just like do something with natural
language processing like you have to
come up with a question you get the data
um but you know there's the instructors
there to help there are other people in
the class there to help
so that worked really well for me i
would say but the advantage i had there
was i
moved home so i moved back to new york
uh so i lived rent-free with my parents
uh and i hadn't like my master's degree
i had a stipend but it wasn't
sort of just enough to live on so it
wasn't like i'd gone from making
you know 70 dollars a year and suddenly
i had to figure out how do i live
without a salary for the three months of
metis
and it's going to take usually a couple
months after graduating to start a job
so i started my job
about three months after medicine ended
so a total of six months
um you know where i wasn't making an
income so you do have to definitely
weigh
that against uh what you can get from
metis but the last thing i'll say also
is helpful is
you know i wouldn't say most boot camps
sort of like moocs they're not gonna
like get you the job or maybe even the
interview by having on your resume it's
much more about the experience
you have there so like what might get
your job is not like oh she went to
metis it's like oh
she did this this uh cool project and i
see this blog post or she made this
dashboard and that's exactly what we
need so why don't we at least talk to
her
um so that's the advantage and finally
uh
it's also helpful that medics now as
well as other bootcamps have
a fair amount of alumni because they've
been around for a few years so that's
also going to be helpful if you're
interested in a company and i did this
when i was looking uh there were fewer
alumni then but there are a few
companies i was interested in
that i talked to a data scientist one
referred me and also the other one said
don't work here which was really helpful
they were like this is not
a good data science team and i never
would have known that if not for having
that connection
uh through metis on reaching out to them
all right um the next question is from
wassela
this might be too specific to answer but
when you're job hunting for your first
data science job
about what application to interview
ratio
would you expect
yeah so and this is really
yeah this is hard to answer because yeah
it's kind of very specific per person
so i think a big thing that influences
this here
is how like selective are you in your
applications like are you only due to
mostly only like i didn't apply to that
many jobs um because i mostly applied
through people i knew
you know referrals or companies i had
connections with so in that case
it was a relatively high application to
um the first interview because
you know like i had like a decent
background and you know i had the
referrals so that was pretty high versus
if i'd applied to a bunch of companies
online cold applications that would have
been very low
uh so you know it really depends and
then it is helpful though to analyze
like
okay what stages is there more drop-off
like if i'm applying a bunch of places
maybe i'm trying with for i'm trying
these things i'm not getting anything
okay maybe i should talk to some people
is it how i present myself on my resume
is it that i'm applying to the wrong
types of jobs like i i
you know it turns out like oh i'm fine
all these jobs that need that really
really want this formal degree that i
don't have
um or no i'm getting the hiring manager
interviews and then i'm not going
forward okay
you know is what can i reflect on that
part and so on and so forth so i think
that's sort of more helpful but i would
say
i saw someone posting today who was laid
off at airbnb and they talked about
their first
data science job search versus their
second and like those ratios and i think
they said like
it was either like ten or five percent
maybe of applications got them to the
next stage
so if that's your case like don't
definitely that's not abnormal again
this person applied to i think like 130
companies so if you're applying to that
many companies
most of them are not going to get back
to you if you don't have previous
experience as a data scientist
okay the next question is how important
is it to get
object-oriented programming concepts
data structures and algorithms to get a
data scientist
job it depends i'll be honest i don't
know i vaguely remember things about
object-oriented program i don't really
need in my job because r is much more
about functional programming although
you can
use object-oriented programming so in my
case like
i'm working i got a job and i'm working
as a data scientist and i don't have
that
but so you know that being said uh
you also mentioned i think like
algorithms and stuff and if you're a
machine learning engineer for example
yes it is important to know
you know like to know like owen write
like the complexity of your algorithms
because you know the speed's gonna
really matter there you know they might
ask you some sorting questions like you
know bubble sort like how did you make
this thing
so it depends but i yeah i would say
object oriented not
necessarily if it's specifically listed
in the job description
it's probably worth brushing up on but i
i wouldn't worry too much about it okay
the next question is
in terms of day-to-day work what are the
differences and similarities between the
work a developer
software engineer does versus what a
data scientist does
yeah i mean this really like software
engineering even of itself like their
day-to-day can look so
different right you might know the terms
like back-end versus front-end engineer
like someone
you know that the programming language
that they use it can be totally
different the types of problems um
but i would say in general like one
thing that engineer much more common
with engineering teams
is to use uh jira or another like task
management tool to have tickets
and to really really like scope down
like okay this is like first i'm gonna
like do this part then i'm gonna do this
part of the product that i'm gonna do
this part because there's
a lot less uncertainty in most of
software engineering like generally
you're not worried like
can i even build this website like you
may have uncertainty about how to build
it but you kind of know what can be done
like someone
hopefully you can do it but someone can
do it versus in data science like a
predictive modeling process like half
the time you find out like oh the data's
not there we need to figure out the data
or
oh this data like tracking down to 20
people to figure out what this data
means like took three days
so that that's delay in the project or
oh i made the model and it just
we we can't like it's trying to predict
you know what's the next dice roll like
even if you have a thousand
data points on the past ice roll you're
never gonna be able to make a predictive
algorithm that predicts the next one uh
so i do think like that's the
uncertainty inheritance data science
does change like some of the process so
some teams some data scientists teams do
use
agile do you use the sprint these
two-week systems um or jira tickets
but i would say not many more software
engineering teams
do uh and again like i don't know the
jobs are
similar like i don't a new code but um
otherwise i think that they're quite
different in the types of problems that
you're working on
the next question is um how real is the
threat of
jobs lost to automated machine learning
tools
aka auto ml
so this actually um i don't think one
it's not very great
because of what i said before that like
so much of the work
is not like optimizing the uh
you know like which like machine
learning algorithm i use it's much about
like how do i get the data what problems
should we even be solving how do i talk
to people how do i put this in
production so it can be
you know like this algorithm needs to
serve our customer service team that's
and it's going to be hit you know 5
million times a week
so i would say not not much uh that
being said like
uh i think uh i'm gonna find it um
eduardo de la rubia had a great pack in
our studio which was not the worry that
like ml teams are gonna be replaced by
automl
but actually that the problem is data
scientists don't necessarily have much
of a
competitive advantage there and
engineers
could actually be the ones replacing
these machine learning teams because you
know they have a lot of the capabilities
and they just have to get up to speed in
the machine learning part
so that actually i think is the the
bigger worry
right there's also the critical thinking
part of it too
which is to put on data science
so the last question
is um as do you know only one job in a
team is related to ml
so would you suggest picking up big data
and cloud computing to break into the
field
yeah so if uh you know that
so big data is tough because like sql
deals with big data uh you know like
etsy
stored like billions of events in our
sql database and i queried it and it
worked very well
but um for like even bigger data we use
uh scalding uh to write uh hadoop jobs
um so that was how uh etsy did it
but another company may use presto
another company may use google bigquery
another company may use this
so i don't the problem is like big data
tools outside of sql are so much more
fractured i don't think it's worth
trying to learn
you know all of them or even one of them
because it may not be the useful one
but cloud computing i think it's
hard to learn on your own uh cloud
computing i do think if it's something
you're interested in it's worth like
playing around with
aws or other tools um but that's also
something you could
pick up on the job um and i i certainly
did i hadn't worked with cloud computing
at all
and then uh well i guess in etsy
actually all the servers were
in a server farm we did not have google
cloud when i was there but then i moved
to data camp they used redshift on aws
and i started picking that up
all right so we have gone through all
the questions
thank you so much for staying good half
hour past our
webinar um so
one of the questions that i've seen so
this this is being recorded it'll be
available and also
the slides will be made available on
your website is that right
yes also uh thank you artemis file also
posted there's an old version of it
um so if you go to my website right now
under speaking i
gave pretty much the same talk uh
in november um and so you can find that
and then i'll also add the slides from
this talk up
tonight and you can review them
okay great thank you so much um for
being here
and your patience and answering all the
questions i think it's a record number
of questions we've had so
yeah i mean thank you all for tuning in
i'm like especially
folks who you know came in in like the
middle of the night or in the morning or
all these things so
i'm just like you know very happy uh you
know feel free if you have
uh like i said i will sort of plug my
own advice again like if you have more
questions like
i think it is worth i actually have a um
blog post on like getting a job and data
science
that i think is worth giving but if you
do have like follow-up questions do feel
free to reach out um
you do it on linkedin please add a
message if you do because i get a lot of
linkedin requests from random people and
i don't usually i don't accept unless
there's a message saying why they
reached out
um or you can reach me on twitter all
right
so um thank you very much and
um yeah looking and uh your book
you to just mention your book again yes
uh so if you like this you like the book
um you can find it at datacycareer.com
or
this is my co-author's short link
bestbook.cool they link to the same
place
that's on manning it's also on amazon
but at manning you have the discount
code
so that's mtp umbrella20 and i also saw
someone said they found a better one
which
great use it which is kd math 50. so i
guess that's 50
off um yeah and you can
you can get it there if you get the
physical book it comes with the ebook or
you can just get the ebook
all right great thank you so much and
thank you for joining us tonight
and uh for more data umbrella events
follow us on meetup and you can see what
is coming up
thank you yeah thank you for hosting
