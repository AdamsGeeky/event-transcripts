This talk focuses on a holistic approach for deploying data science projects into production (e.g., CI/CD) with the use of open-source and free tools such as R, bash, Docker, Github Actions, etc. During this talk, we will review the general architect of a Covid19 cases tracker that automatically gets updated daily (see: https://ramikrispin.github.io/italy_dash/).
