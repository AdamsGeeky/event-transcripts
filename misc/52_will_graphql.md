## About the Event
This session will introduce GraphQL, with a focus on the use of GraphQL in data science. We will start with an overview of GraphQL, including the advantages/disadvantages of using GraphQL. Next, we will explore common patterns for building GraphQL APIs. Finally, we will see how GraphQL can be integrated into common data science workflows using Python and Jupyter notebooks.
