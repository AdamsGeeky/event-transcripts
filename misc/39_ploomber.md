00:36:00 Q&A
 
## Event
Jupyter notebooks are a prevalent tool for Data Science work; however, notebooks can get out of control quickly, making them hard to maintain and collaborate. Ploomber is an open-source framework that brings software engineering best practices to the Jupyter world to create more maintainable projects. This talk will describe the project's motivations and showcase its main features.
