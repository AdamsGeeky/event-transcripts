## Event
Jupyter notebooks are a prevalent tool for Data Science work; however, notebooks can get out of control quickly, making them hard to maintain and collaborate. Ploomber is an open-source framework that brings software engineering best practices to the Jupyter world to create more maintainable projects. This talk will describe the project's motivations and showcase its main features.

## About the Speaker
Eduardo is interested in developing tools to deliver reliable Machine Learning products. Towards that end, he created Ploomber, an open-source Python library to compose production-ready data workflows. Eduardo holds an M.S in Data Science from Columbia University, where he took part in Computational Neuroscience research. Eduardo started his Data Science career in 2015 at the Center for Data Science and Public Policy at The University of Chicago.
