## Event
If you’ve never heard of the “good, fast, cheap” dilemma, it goes something like this: You can have something good and fast, but it won’t be cheap. You can have something good and cheap, but it won’t be fast. You can have something fast and cheap, but it won’t be good. In short, you can pick two of the three but you can’t have all three.

If you’ve done a data science problem before, I can all but guarantee that you’ve run into missing data. How do we handle it? Well, we can avoid, ignore, or try to account for missing data. The problem is, none of these strategies are good, fast, and cheap.

We’ll walk through advantages and disadvantages of various approaches and cover practical recommendations for integrating best missing data practices into your workflow!
