## Agenda
00:00:00 Reshama introduces Data Umbrella
00:04:07 Sean begins talk 
00:05:14 The time series business problem
00:08:00 Overview: Visualizations, Statistics, ARIMA, Anomaly Detection, Forecasting, Machine Learning, Clustering, Dymamic Time Warping
00:10:00 Deep Learning
00:11:38 Simple dataset example: Time series with length, n=13 (look for repeat patterns, anomalies)
00:12:20 Subsequence: a portion or section of the full time series
00:12:55 What's the goal in analyzing time series data?
00:13:30 Question: Do any conserved behaviors exist in my time series data?
00:13:50 Occam's Razor: simpler solutions are more likely to be correct than complex ones
00:14:15 Simple and intuitive approaches to analyzing time series data: easy to interpret, user/data agnostic, no prior knowledge, parameter free (or limited)
00:15:55 Parameters to choose: subsequence length m
00:16:20 Using Euclidean distance to compare two subsequences (Pythagorean Theorem)



## Event
STUMPY is a powerful and scalable library that efficiently computes something called the matrix profile, which can be used for a variety of time series data mining tasks.

## About the Speaker
Sean Law is a senior applied scientific researcher and lead data scientist currently working with a multi-talented R&D team at Charles Schwab. He has experience producing cutting edge methodologies, building high-performance predictive models, and developing rapid prototypes. Additionally, he is one of the co-organizers of PyData Ann Arbor and is also the creator and core maintainer of STUMPY, a powerful and scalable open source Python library that can be used for a variety of time series data mining tasks..
