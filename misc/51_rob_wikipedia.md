## Event

Rob Lanphier, a longtime editor of English Wikipedia, will describe how to get over one's existential dread of SCREWING UP WIKIPEDIA and making some changes to the mistakes. As it turns out, there are a few mistakes on English Wikipedia, not to mention the hundreds of other languages (some of which were introduced by Rob). Rob will also describe some of the resources available to Python developers, and describe how to see which articles get loaded by people all over the world. He'll also leave plenty of time for questions, to each of which his answer may have something to do with the question.
 
 
## Speaker

Rob Lanphier (LAN-fear) is a graduate of University of Idaho, where he earned a Bachelors of Computer Science back in the early days of the Internet. After college, he moved to the Puget Sound region of Washington state, which includes such cities Bellevue, Bothell and Seattle. He worked at such companies as Microsoft, Asymetrix, Conjungi, and RealNetworks.

Then in 2010, the folks at Wikimedia Foundation (the non-profit that hosts Wikipedia) noticed that Rob had been and editor since the very early days of Wikipedia (since 2001), and hired him to manage employees outside of San Francisco (in faraway places like Australia, The Netherlands, and New York City). They, of course, insisted that he move to San Francisco, which he did. After leaving Wikimedia Foundation, Rob still edited Wikipedia, even while working at Internet Archive. He's here to talk about editing Wikipedia, which he's been doing for over twenty years.
