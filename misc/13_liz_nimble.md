## Event
COVID-19 has greatly impacted communities around the world and, while there is still much uncertainty around the pandemic, what is certain is that these moments of crisis offer organizations the opportunity to be hyper-responsive to the needs of their stakeholders. With shifts in resources and services comes the need to change how we track, evaluate, and communicate organizational efforts and outcomes.

In this workshop, we will explore a process and tools by which to rapidly and nimbly identify needed metrics, create data collection systems, and design reporting dashboards with minimal effort and upkeep. Attendees will leave with a basic understanding of:

1. How to use participatory methods to identify the critical metrics needed for informing, evaluating, and communicating about new programs or initiatives.
2. How Google and Microsoft Forms can provide the format for responsive data collection
3. How Google Data Studio and Microsoft PowerBI can assist with real-time analyses of key metrics for easy and interactive reporting.
