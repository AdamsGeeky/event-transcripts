## Event
Configuring your terminal and learning how to use the command line from scratch can be a daunting task with a pretty high time investment initially. In this talk we're going to cover what makes the command line useful, practical work flows (live demos), picking a terminal and shell, customizing your prompt, using and configuring tools like tmux and Vim, the concept of dotfiles and if time permits using various Unix tools together to solve real world problems. By the end of the talk you'll be well on your way to having a tricked out command line focused development environment.
