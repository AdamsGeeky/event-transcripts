## Event
Visualizations help data scientists discover trends, patterns, identify outliers, and derive insights from their data. However, existing visualization libraries in Python require users to write a substantial amount of code for plotting even a single visualization, often hindering the flow of data exploration. In this talk, you will learn about Lux, a lightweight visualization tool on top of Pandas dataframes. Lux recommends visualizations for free to users as they explore their data within a Jupyter notebook without the need to write additional code.
