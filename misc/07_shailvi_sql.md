## Event
Have you dealt with disparate data sources that just WOULD NOT reconcile?
Two numbers in your data that really should be the same?
An analysis with suspicious results?

Data scientists are often the resident detectives in a company that solve data riddles that can leave the best of us scratching our heads. To make these problem-solving tactics more methodical, I propose a framework that can lead to structured execution to help you succeed.

The framework is inspired by of the mental traits of the popular detective, Sherlock Holmes, because of his scientific approach to solving problems.

Iâ€™ll also share some SQL code that can be repurposed for your own bad data analyses.
