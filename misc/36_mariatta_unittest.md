## Event
Having unit tests and continuous integration (CI) as part of your development are considered best practises. But how do these things work? In this talk, we will cover the benefits of writing unit tests and how to get started with it in Python. Then, we'll step it up running tests as part CI. And that's not all! CI is not just about running tests, but for other things as well, like code quality checks, and even building and generating documentation.
