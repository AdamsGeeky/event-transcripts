## Agenda
00:00:00 Reshama introduces Data Umbrella
00:06:10 Oriol begins talk 

 
## Event
In this task we'll give an overview of PyMC3, and why you should supercharge your data science skills with probabilistic programming. The talk is organized by layers from more generic to more specific. We will cover the main features of the Bayesian paradigm, then probabilistic progamming, then PyMC3 and we will finish covering some hands on examples of Bayesian modeling with PyMC3.

## About the Speaker
I am a Bayesian statistics and open source sofware enthusiast currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at Helsinki Uni. I am also a member of the ArviZ and PyMC teams.
