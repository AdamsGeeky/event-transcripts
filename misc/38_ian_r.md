## Agenda
00:00:00 Introduction to Data Umbrella 
00:06:58 Ian begins
00:08:03 Talk Outline
00:09:35 3 Types of sharing data with computers (web APIs, cloud storage, database)
00:10:27 Web APIs: Overview
00:13:00 Accessing data from APIs using Python (urlib3, requests)
00:14:38 Serving data with APIs using Python (flask, FastAPI)
00:16:22 Accessing data from APIs using Rstats (httr2, curl)
00:18:20 Serving data with APIs using R (plumber)
00:19:51 Web APIs: {plumber}
00:20:50 Cloud storage - overview
00:25:04 Cloud storage - formats (JSON, YAML, CSV, TSV) 
00:26:02 Binary formats of data; Don't use: pickles, RDS; Do use: parquet, feather, avro
00:27:49 Data storage - databases (SQL) (Database Drivers packages: odbc, DBI, dplyr)
00:30:52 Sharing ~data~/insights with humans
00:31:44 RMarkdown *down-verse ({pkgdown}, {bookdown}, {blogdown}); Extensibility through YAML header ({glosario}, {lambdr}, {xaringan})
00:35:43 Quarto (Jupyter notebooks, Knitr, ObservableJS)
00:36:44 Shiny (Example website: https://voronoys.shinyapps.io/voronoys/)
00:37:40 Shiny and other Python frameworks (Streamlit, Dash, Voila)
00:39:45 R Tools Pythonistas should know
00:40:14 {reticulate} package (call Python from within R)
00:42:03 Workflows in R: {targets} (make-like pipeline toolkit for statistics and data science in R)
00:43:25 {tidyverse} R packages for data science (read, clean, manipulate, visualize, etc. for data); compare to SciPy stack
00:44:47 Similarities across R and Python; virtual environments: {renv}, virtualenv
00:46:28 Similarities: Class Systems
00:47:30 Limitations of R
00:50:22 Packages in R to work with the cloud
00:51:03 Case study: Data Pipeline (https://github.com/ian-flores/r-ecosystem-4-python)
00:56:30 Q&A begins
00:58:10 Q: Is it advisable to work with R and Python together?
00:58:50 Q: working with different versions of R and Python
00:59:30 Q: How efficient is it to use packages such as reticulate to work with both R and Python in the same document?
01:00:22 Q: Can you use FastAPI within R?
01:01:05 Q: What are commonly accessed Python libraries within R's reticulate package?
01:02:22 Q: What does python's scikit-learn have that is not available in R?
01:04:45 Q: Is R a good option for large datasets and production?
01:06:28 Q: Can you talk about RStudio, the company? 
01:08:30 Demo of RStudio IDE
 
## Event
This talk will introduce Python users to the R ecosystem. Attendees should expect that by the end of the talk they will understand how to get started with reporting infrastructure in Python and R; and how to use open standards to share data across data products. As part of the discussion, we will see different use cases for both languages, their integration, and common pitfalls.
