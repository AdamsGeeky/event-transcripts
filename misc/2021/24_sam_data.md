## Event
We’ll explore the landscape of data quality related open source libraries including: Pandas Profiling, TDDA, pydqc, Bulwark, Engarde, Voluptous, Opulent Pandas, mobydq, dvc, dedupe, datacleaner, and Great Expectations as a final destination.

In this talk, we’ll give you an overview of the Wonderful World of Data Quality in Python, with a focus on Great Expectations. We’ll first look at the landscape of data quality related open source libraries and look at a few examples such as pydqc, datagristle, bulwark, dvc, dedupe, and others, to give you an idea of the space. In the second half, we will take a closer look at Great Expectations, one of the most popular open source Python packages for data validation and documentation. We’ll demo how to create and run test suites with Great Expectations, and show you how to use the profiling feature to automatically create data tests for you.


## Pre-reqs
No skills needed to follow, but some basic level of Python and understanding of/interest in data quality challenges is probably helpful.
