## Agenda
00:00:00 Reshama introduces Data Umbrella
00:05:20 Thomas begins talk 
00:06:35 Terms: pull request, reviewer, contributor, merged  
00:07:12 PART 1: Mechanics of Code Review. Why code review?  
00:19:10 Browsing Code in GitHub  
00:21:50 shift+click: highlight multiple lines  
00:22:18 GitHub b: blame, tells last contributor to the code 
00:23:12 Overview of Mechanics   
00:24:12 Q: How does a suggestion get incorporated into the code? how to sync local repo? 
00:27:02 PART 2: Social Aspects of Reviewing a Pull Request 
00:27:58 Tip 1 for giving feedback: Ask, don't tell 
00:28:46 Tip 2 for giving feedback: Offer alternative implementations 
00:29:56 Tip 3 for giving feedback: Explain why code should be changed
00:39:56 DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself; refactor, having common logic in multiple places, rewrite code so you have same funtionality, but this makes code more maintainable
00:31:50 Avoid using derogatory terms
00:32:32 Tip 4: Be humble, assume everyone is intelligent and well-meaning
00:33:15 Tip 5: Ask for clarification
00:34:11 Tip 6: Communicate which ideas you do not feel strongly about
00:35:02 Tip 7: Try to leave a positive comment
00:35:33 Tip 8: Thank contributors for their work
00:35:56 General Social Aspects
00:36:37 Disagreement
00:37:39 Talk synchronously (talk, take notes, update PR with notes to document discussion)
00:38:45 Overview of Social Aspects
00:39:05 PART 3: Technical Aspects
00:39:52 Presentation: how your PR is presented? description of PR
00:42:00 Was unrelated code changed?
00:42:55 Is the PR easy to review?
00:44:45 Engineering, Technical Aspects
00:44:58 Every change should be intentional
00:45:10 Offer ways to simplify or improve code
00:46:20 Does the change maintain backwards compatibility
00:48:42 Performance optimizations, require benchmarks
00:49:32 Is there documentation?
00:51:05 Code comments
00:52:15 Testing! (are there tests, and more)
00:54:08 What does it mean when CI tests fail?
00:55:42 It's ok to make mistakes
00:56:53 Q&A

## Event
A pull request is a method for submitting contributions to a software project. Maintainers or contributors review these pull requests to discuss the proposed changes and help ensure the changes meet the project guidelines and quality standards. In this talk, we will learn about three components for reviewing a pull request:

1. The mechanics of code review on GitHub.
2. The social aspects of code review and how to effectively give feedback.
3. The technical aspects of reviewing a pull request.
