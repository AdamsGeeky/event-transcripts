## About the Speaker
I am a Colombian Civil Engineer with an MSc. in Hydroinformatics and an MSc. in Sanitary Engineering that discovered a passion for Software Development and Data Science which led me to collaborate in different open source projects and to eventually join Anaconda, Inc (formerly known as Continuum Analytics) and currently Quansight, Inc as Senior Software Engineer, and Data Scientist (in development). I am an active member of the open source community contributing to different projects and a leader in the Python Colombia Community helping shape and organize communities such as Django Girls Colombia, Python Bucaramanga, Python Colombia and the national and Latin American Python Conferences, PyCon Colombia (2018, 2019, 2020) and SciPy Latam (2019, 2021) respectively. I am currently a core developer with Project Jupyter and Project napari. I am the author of the setup-miniconda Github Action to help automate conda environment and workflows.
