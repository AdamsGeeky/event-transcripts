## Agenda
00:00:00 Reshama introduces Data Umbrella
00:xx:xx Ricardo begins

## Event
From first time contributor to project maintainer. What is it like? In this testimonial I'll revisit the steps of my first ever contributions to Open Source Software, to the PyMC library. I will then jump one year into the present and show what reviewing someone else's first time contribution looks like. Hopefully, this will help demystify open source contributions without taking any of the magic out of them!
