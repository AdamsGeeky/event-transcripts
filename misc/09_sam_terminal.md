## Event
"The Keyboard Is Mightier Than The Mouse" - in some cases at least! In this talk, you will learn the basics of a shell, aka how to use the Terminal on your Mac or Linux computer. The workshop will focus on navigating the file system, modifying files, and doing some simple batch operations. This will be useful for anyone who's getting started with coding, using remote servers, and tools like git that require some use of the Terminal.
