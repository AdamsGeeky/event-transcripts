ABOUT
Live Share is an extension from Visual Studio Code that allows you to collaboratively edit and debug with others in real-time. It allows you to instantly share your current project, edit snippets of code at the same time or follow someoneâ€™s cursor while they program. These are extremely helpful when you are pair-programming using the driver-navigator technique 1. While the driver codes, the navigator can observe, check other sources, or suggest changes.
