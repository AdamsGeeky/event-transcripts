We are honored to have Coonoor Behal, author of the book "I Quit! The Live Affirming Joy of Giving Up".  You can find the book here:
https://www.amazon.com/Quit-Life-Affirming-Joy-Giving-Up-ebook/dp/B093QN3GXJ

This book will challenge you to rethink quitting and encourage you to re-examine how you make—or don’t make—bold choices in your own life.

Author Coonoor Behal has written a collection of stories about everyday people who summoned the courage to quit things in their lives. Here you’ll find intriguing stories of the jobs, people, aspirations, habits, and identities people decided to leave behind; typically in defiance of family, social, and cultural expectations.

I Quit! encourages the reader to:
- Be inspired and motivated to make decisive, big life choices
- Analyze and reframe their own quitting stories
- Appreciate challenging the status quo with irreverent humor

Let "I Quit! The Life-Affirming Joy of Giving Up" be the motivation you need to upend the status quo and make a positive change for yourself.
