## Agenda
00:00:00 Reshama introduces Data Umbrella
00:03:46 Reshama introduces Thomas 
00:04:37 Thomas begins talk  

 
## Event
Streamlit is an open source Python library that makes it easy to build web applications for data science and machine learning. It integrates with many plotting libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly for showing visualizations in your application. In this talk, we will develop a dashboard which will introduce streamlit's features and capabilities. Afterwards, we will develop a web application that integrates SHAP and anchor explanations for a model's prediction based on user input.

## About the Speaker
Thomas J. Fan is a Staff Associate at the Data Science Institute at Columbia University. He is one of the core developers of scikit-learn, an open source machine learning library written in Python. He also maintains skorch, a scikit-learn compatible neural network library that wraps PyTorch. Thomas believes that developing open source software is one of the best ways to maximize one's impact.
