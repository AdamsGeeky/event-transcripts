## Event
Open source data visualization tools are increasing the ways that we can interact with massive datasets in meaningful ways. Bokeh is an interactive visualization library built for modern web browsers. It is a great tool for displaying large datasets in the form of interactive plots, dashboards and apps.

Bokeh is used across a variety of fields, but especially for data science. Because it is interactive, it can be a key asset for biomedical research as it simplifies visual exploration and analysis of large amounts of data.
