## Event

Learn how to use HoloViz tools to visualize tabular and array data in Python.

After attending this, you should be able to:
(1) Quickly inspect your data using `hvplot`.
(2) Aggregate large data to the pixel level using `datashader`.
(3) Produce dashboards that allow others to easily view your outputs using `panel`.
 
## Speaker

Julia has worked in the scientific Python ecosystem as an environmental researcher, an open source contributor, and on both the frontend and backend data science platform product teams. She is passionate about finding creative ways to enhance understanding of the physical world.
In her current role as Head of Open Source at Saturn Cloud she helps to maintain Dask and contribute to product management and engineering.
Before joining Saturn she worked on the HoloViz team at Anaconda and as a hydrometeorology researcher at Princeton University.
