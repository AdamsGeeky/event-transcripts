## Event

Plotly is an interactive web-based visualization library. It is written in Javascript, but is mostly used from its Python API (and it also has an R and a Julia API). plotly has a large variety of traces and is highly customizable. In addition to the low-level API, a higher-level API for dataframe-like data makes it possible to create complex plots as one-liners. My talk will present the plotly library and how to use it for data science projects. I will finish the talk by presenting annotation and drawing tools within plotly figures, which we have developed in particular for image processing tasks.

## About the Speaker

Emmanuelle Gouillart is a scientific Python developer at Plotly, where she is a core developer of the plotly.py visualization library. She has a background in physics and materials science, and she has carried on scientific research and software development during the last years. She became a core contributor of Python's popular image processing library scikit-image since a large part of her research relies on extracting quantitative data from image datasets. She has been a co-organizer of the Euroscipy conference during the last ten years, and she enjoys very much discussing with Python users about image processing and visualization at conferences
