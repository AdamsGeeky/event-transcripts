## Event
The best software libraries of the world are severely restrictive and inaccessible if they are not properly documented, resulting in few or no users. PyMC has an extensive documentation corpus with examples of all kinds which has been built since its initial release back in 2015! In this webinar weâ€™ll explain how to contribute to PyMC documentation to update it to our new infrastructure built during the last 8 months thanks to Outreachy and GSoD (Google Season of Docs).

You'll learn how to use MyST (a superset of Markdown) to write technical documentation, using multiple types of cross-references, adding beautiful styling elements, figures with captions... all while using executable Jupyter notebooks!

## About the Speaker
