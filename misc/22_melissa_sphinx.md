## Event
This webinar will focus on a high-level explanation of how the Sphinx tool for generating documentation automatically works for Python packages, using NumPy as an example (but won't be restricted to the NumPy use case). We'll talk about advantages and disadvantages of choosing different documentation systems and how to integrate other types of documents (for example, Jupyter Notebooks) in the documentation for a given package.
