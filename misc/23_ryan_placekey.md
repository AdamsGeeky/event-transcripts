## Event
This webinar will introduce you to Placekey, a handy tool for joining geospatial data, applied to building a "political census." Political affiliation data is typically only available at the county or district level, but Placekey allows us to join foot traffic data (from SafeGraph) with Election Day voter results to estimate political affiliation at much higher resolution. We'll talk about some of the limitations of our analysis, and we'll also briefly survey the value Placekey brings over some of the other tools out there.

##About Placekey
What is Placekey?

Placekey is a free, universal standard identifier for any physical place, so that the data pertaining to those places can be shared across organizations easily.

However, Placekey goes beyond just an identifier. Itâ€™s a movement of organizations and individuals that prize access to data. Placekey members want geospatial data that is easily joined and combined...because real answers come from combining data from many different sources. It is a philosophy that data should be easy to access, and data should not be hoarded. These members believe that data, when combined, can do massive good.

## Speaker
I completed my Master's in Data Science at Minnesota State University-Mankato in December 2020. I work as a Data Science Consultant/Community Manager for SafeGraph. I enjoy using data in creative ways to solve problems.
