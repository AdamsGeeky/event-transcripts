## About the Speaker
Dr. Emily Lescak is the Senior Research Community Officer at The Wikimedia Foundation, where she focuses on supporting, growing, and diversifying the global community of Wikimedia researchers. She began her data science career as a fisheries researcher in both the academic and government sectors. She transitioned full-time to non-profit program and community management work two years ago when she developed and managed Code for Science & Society's Event Fund, which provides financial and programmatic support to organizers of open data science events.

Diego SÃ¡ez Trumper is Chilean computer scientist, currently working as a Senior Research Scientist at the Wikimedia Foundation and Visiting Research Fellow at University Pompeu Fabra, where he obtained his PhD in 2013 under the supervision of Ricardo Baeza-Yates. Before, Diego worked as researcher and data scientist at NTENT, Eurecat, QCRI and Yahoo Labs. He has also been a visitor and collaborator of several universities such as UMFG (Brazil), Cambridge (UK), and UCU (Ukraine). His research focuses on the usage of data science to understand and deal with the diffusion of (dis)information in online platforms.
