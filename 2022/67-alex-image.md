## About the Event
This presentation will introduce how to analyze three dimensional stacked and volumetric images in Python, mainly using scikit-image. Here we will study how to preprocess data using filtering, binarization and segmentation techniques. Also, we will inspect, count and measure attributes of objects and regions of interest in the data. We will finish the tutorial presenting tools to visualize 3D data.
