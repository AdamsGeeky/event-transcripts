## About the Event
Ever wondered how people do all those nice data visualizations out there? How could you start to do some too? In my talk I will present some of my contributions to the #30DayChartChallenge as short stories. I will focus on where did I get my ideas, what was my process, what tools did I use and some best practices I learned. Hopefully after this talk you will be motivated to get started with data visualization and participate in a challenge
