## Event

In this workshop we will use pandas, plotly and Dash to create a dashboard that explores changes in the average housing price in various provinces in Canada for the last 5 years. We will start by generating interactive visualizations using plotly and turn exploratory code into reusable functions. We will then work together to bring our functions into a script. Participants will be introduced into dashboarding, layout options, and will work together to generate and test a local dashboard.
