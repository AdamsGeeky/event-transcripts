## About the Event
Our goal is to provide a wholistic introduction to Bayesian modeling for data scientists as well as to demonstrate best practices for Bayesian data analysis and prediction. We use the Stan probabilistic programming language and inference engines to do inference, and the plotnine package for visualization. Applied statistical modeling starts with the question we are trying to answer and the available data. We must understand both the data and the analysis goals before proceeding to model building. We use the Stan probabilistic programming language and inference engine to build and fit our models, via modern Python interface CmdStanPy, and we use the Python package plotnine for visualization.

## About the Speaker
Mitzi Morris is a member of the Stan development team. As a software engineer, she has contributed to the core Stan C++ infrastructure and authored CmdStanPy . As a Bayesian data analyst, she has helped epidemiologists use Bayesian method for disease mapping. Her background is software engineering and natural language processing, with a detour through genomics and bioinformatics.
